JCS Media Library (JCSML)

Imagine you could create complex animations that look the same on IE7+, Android, and iPhone/iPad. Now, imagine that it does not use Flash, SilverLight, SVG, or HTML5. Create professional quality jQuery animations and special effects that work on all major browsers and devices. Build the same animations found on the website learnjcsml.com using this high powered library that is compliant with all devices, platforms, and browsers!

I wrote this library when I found that Flash would not be supported on the iPhone. I was also tired of not being able to support my IE7 clients with the same caliber effects I could produce in chrome/FF. This library took 8 months of pain-staking testing on many devices/platforms/browsers and their various versions before being released.

This library really needs an online designer folks....and emit the final scripts and packaged images.
